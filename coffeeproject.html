        <h1>A CUP ABOVE</h1>
        <p>Since 1988 we've been roasting responsible sourced coffee beans
            and crafting them into beverages using ingredients we're proud of
            Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to
            its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and
            presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).
            It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream
            are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or
            another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is
            known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

    <h3>Types of Coffee</h3>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="box">
            <h5>Black Coffee</h5>
            <p class="describe">Black coffee is a beverage made from roasted coffee beans. The beans are ground and
                soaked in water, which releases their flavor, color, caffeine content, and nutrients. Although coffee is
                often served hot, it can also be served iced.

                In many countries, including the United States, coffee is typically enjoyed with breakfast. It’s favored
                in the mornings because its caffeine content offers stimulating effects that may help people feel more
                awake (1Trusted Source).

                Many people add creamer, milk, half-and-half, sugar, or sweetener to their coffee to make it creamy,
                reduce the bitter flavor, or both.</p>

            <h5>Cappuccino</h5>
            <p class="describe">
                A cappuccino (/ˌkæpʊˈtʃiːnoʊ/ (audio speaker iconlisten); Italian pronunciation: [kapputˈtʃiːno];
                Italian plural: cappuccini) is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Austria with later
                development taking place in Italy, and is prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).[1]

                Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and
                flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.[2][3] It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte,
                with a thicker layer of microfoam.[4]
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h5>Latte</h5>
            <p class="describe">
                Caffè latte (Italian: [kafˌfɛ lˈlatte][1][2]), often shortened to just latte (/ˈlɑːteɪ, ˈlæteɪ/)[3][4]
                in English, is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk.

                The term comes from the Italian caffellatte[5] or caffè latte, from caffè e latte, literally "coffee and
                milk"; in English orthography either or both words sometimes have an accent on the final e (a
                hyperforeignism or to indicate it is pronounced, not the more-common silent final e of English). In
                northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination
                of espresso and milk. In France

            <h5>Mocha</h5>
            <p class="descriptn">
                A café mocha (/ˈmɒkə/ or /ˈmoʊkə/), also called mocaccino (Italian: [mokatˈtʃiːno]), is a
                chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a café latte (Italian: [kafˈfɛ lˈlatte]),[1]
                commonly served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino[2] and also
                mochachino. The name is derived from the city of Mocha, Yemen, which was one of the centres of early
                coffee trade.[3] Like latte, the name is commonly shortened to just mocha.
                Like café latte, café mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and
                sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead,
                and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.

            <h5>Red Eye</h5>
            <p class="descriptn">
                Red eye coffee is a coffee drink that combines drip coffee with one or two shots of espresso. The name
                likely refers to taking a “red eye flight,” an airline flight that’s overnight, causing the passengers
                to have tired red eyes.
                There are a few variations on the name of this drink that refer to the amount of espresso shots: red eye
                is 1 shot, black eye is 2 shots, and dead eye or green eye is 3 shots. But if you’re ordering at a
                coffeeshop, you should be able to simply order a “red eye coffee” and specify the number of espresso
                shots you’d like. Here’s what’s in this drink:

            <h5>Irish</h5>
            <p class="descriptn">
                Irish coffee (Irish: caife Gaelach) is a caffeinated alcoholic drink consisting of hot coffee, Irish
                whiskey, and sugar, stirred, and topped with cream. The coffee is drunk through the cream.
                Different variations of coffee cocktails pre-date the now-classic Irish coffee by at least 100 years.

                From the mid-19th century, the Pharisäer and the Fiaker were served in Viennese coffee houses; both were
                coffee cocktails served in glass, topped with whipped cream. The former was also known in northern
                Germany and Denmark around that time. Around 1900, the coffee cocktail menu in the Viennese cafés also
                included Kaisermelange
